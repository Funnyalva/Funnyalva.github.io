This is the first github account I have created. I have used github before to download files but this is the first time im using it for creating a repository
This repository is created for educational purposes, I named it after my username and I plan to further develop it as time moves forward
To clone this repository I first had to download Github for desktop. After installing and logging in, the first thing that popped up was an option to clone my repository. I hit clone and it is currently residing in my documents folder.
